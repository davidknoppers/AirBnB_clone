# AirBnB_clone
Holberton Clone of AirBnB Website
# Description
AirBnB Website parts:

1. A website (front-end) that shows the final product.
2. An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)
3. A database or files that store data (data = objects)
4. A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)
